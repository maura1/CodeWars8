//Given an array of integers, return a new array with each value doubled.

//It is always going to be integers
//For example:
//[ 1,2,3] -->[2,4,6]
//[8,2,3] -->[16,4,3]

//Make a function that takes in an array
//Map throught the array and multiply each element by 2

const maps = (arr) => arr.map((element) => element * 2);
console.log(maps[(1, 2, 4)], [2, 4, 8]); //the expected outcome is the array on the right
